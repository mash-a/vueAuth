/*if using passport, there is a isLoggedIn built-in function 
need to add passport plugin called Bearer Token that automatically 
takes the token if you want to use jsonwebtokens, it is called http bearer strategy on the passport website
still would need to do token verification
hashing and inserting into db and validation would still need to occur
it really only does the middlewares and making sure that a user is logged in
added benefits - if local auth is hooked up to password
it is that much easier to add oauth google, fb, twitter to app
